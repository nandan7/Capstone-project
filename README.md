This is a full stack web application done using angular,java and oracle database.

In this project we can register for different colleges for admissions in only 1 website, but for time-being i have only added 1 university for registering.
Where frontend part was done in angular and i have added different modules and forms, and the backend part was done in eclipse and connected it to the oracle database using hibernate. We can register for the university using a form, all the details will be stored in the database and college administration would connect with the people using those details which are stored.
